# MoneyThink-MIRT
Metrics Insights Reporting Tool (MIRT) is a web application that I developed for MoneyThink, a financial literacy organization at Carnegie Mellon University. MIRT allows MoneyThink mentors to collect metrics from their classrooms (attendance, quiz scores, etc.) and gain data-driven insights to improve their instruction. MIRT will be actively used by 40 MoneyThink mentors to improve learning outcomes for over 250 Pittsburgh high school students in the Spring semester.

Technologies: MIRT is powered by a Ruby on Rails backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive front end.
